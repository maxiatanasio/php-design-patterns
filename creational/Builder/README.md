# The Builder design patterns

This pattern is use to create objects made from a bunch of other objects.
Only the builder knows the specifics to build the object.

## Use cases

- When you want to create an object made up from other objects
- When you want to decouple the creation logic from the objects itself
- When you want to hide the creation of the parts from the client
